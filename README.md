# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge
README.md has details of files and answers question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

Folder Credit_Risk holds the file credit_risk_classification.ipynb for the homework.

How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?
For Healthy Loans:
Precision: 1.00
recall: 0.99

High-Risk Loans:
Precision: 0.84
recall: 0.99

Looking at healthy loans precision closer and seeing 1.0 would mean to look at the outcome of data to be sure its accurate as 100.0 precission is not always a good sign.
Looking at precision for high-risk loans being 0.84 could be higher but within a standard that it can be used to identiy high-risk loans.
